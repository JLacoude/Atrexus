<p>Atrexus is a simple strategy game in which you use Action Points to create soldiers and use them to attack other soldiers or capture headquarters. But it comes with a twist: the players from one army can use any soldiers created by other players from the same army.</p>
<h2>How to get started</h2>
<p>You can try the game without registering. You will have access to public battlefields and your actions and statistics will be linked to your IP address.
If you want to be sure to keep those or have access to more battlefields, you will have to create an account.</p>');
